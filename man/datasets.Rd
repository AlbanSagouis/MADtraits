\description{
Each of these functions downloads a dataset from a published
dataset that (to the best of the authors' knowledge) has been
released for public use. Please note that it is *impossible* for
NATDB to download a dataset that has not been released to the user;
NATDB is Not A DataBase; these functions download data to which the
user already has access.
}
\examples{
# You almost certainly *don't* want to use these functions on their own
# - use the function "natdb" to build a database instead
.pearse.2014()

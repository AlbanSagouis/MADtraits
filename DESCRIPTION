Description: NATDB automates the download and assembly of species'
    trait data from published sources. It emphatically is *not* a
    trait database (the clue is in the name): it assembles data that
    are already available for the user, but this is a software package
    that builds a database, not the database itself. Those who have
    contributed trait data that is downloaded should, of course, be
    appropriately referenced when their data are used (tools are
    available within this package to aid that). Some basic data
    checking, and functions to perform data checking, are included
    within this package.
